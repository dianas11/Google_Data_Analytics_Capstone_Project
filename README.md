# Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project
Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing program which features more than 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations.
It offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike.
It was founded in 2016 and has grown tremendously into a fleet of bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. 
The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 

Previously, Cyclistic's marketing strategy tried to build the general awareness and appeal to broad consumers.
It has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. 
Those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders while those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 


My Role: I am a junior data analyst at Cyclistic and my team has been tasked with the overall goal (see below) of designing marketing strategies 


Overall Goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.


Business Question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
